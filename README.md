csharp_MovieRental
==================

### Prerequisites:

* Visual Studio 2010

### Overview & About

This C# application is the first database integration I used within a C# application using a MS Access DB, allows to add and remove movies to the system, add and remove members, and have members only rent 1 movie out at a time and movies can only be rented out by one person at a time.

###Current Problems
Can not search movies by avilability or Genre.
